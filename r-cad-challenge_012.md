# r/CAD/Challenge #12

Tesla model 3 Design Engineers called up for your help! They have instructed you to complete the following;

Create a new design for the alloy wheel to fit on the next Tesla model 3. It must be unique and fit with the wheel hub and also the thread alignment for the bolts. You will need to research the dimensions for the bore and bolt PCD yourself, however this information is readily available with one search.

## Challenge A (Beginner)

Create a 2D or 3D prototype design for the alloy wheel

## Challenge B (Moderate)

Create a 3D solid model of the alloy wheel. Throw in a render.

## Challenge C (Advanced)

Complete the 3D solid model of the alloy and include your own tyre design to fit it. Throw in a render of the full wheel to complete it.
