Design the following Gear train. Contain it properly and provide an animation of it working.The blue gears are 7 and 21 teeth, while the green gears are 9 and 30 teeth.

*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. If you're one of them. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can. This means that you need to redraw this drawing and then make your own 2D drawing with all the dimensions that you'd need to copy the part. Good Luck!*

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA?*

## Challenge B (Moderate)

Reproduce this model and create an easy to read drawing. Any missing dimensions should be estimated.

*The moderate challenge is for those who don't want to bother with the beginner but think the advanced is a bit too... advanced*

## Challenge C (Advanced)

This weeks Advanced challenge includes your own research. Find standard dimensions for any type of bearings and recreate it. Make it an assembly, contain it properly, and give it realistic textures. Create easy to read drawings and good section views to show how the internals work.

*Prove your worth with this challenge! Make a production drawing, render it in outer space, break the internet while uploading it. In other words: impress us.*
