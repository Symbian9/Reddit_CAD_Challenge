*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can, if you're one of them.*

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA?*

*The moderate challenge is for those who don't want to bother with the beginner but think the advanced is a bit too... advanced*
