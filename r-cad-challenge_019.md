*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. If you're one of them. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can. This means that you need to redraw this drawing and then make your own 2D drawing with all the dimensions that you'd need to copy the part. Good Luck!*

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA?*

## Challenge B (Moderate)

*The moderate challenge is for those who don't want to bother with the beginner but think the advanced is a bit too... advanced*

## Challenge C (Advanced)

*Prove your worth with this challenge! Make a production drawing, render it in outer space, break the internet while uploading it. In other words: impress us.*
