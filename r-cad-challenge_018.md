*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. If you're one of them. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can. This means that you need to redraw this drawing and then make your own 2D drawing with all the dimensions that you'd need to copy the part. Good Luck!*

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA?*

## Challenge B (Moderate)
