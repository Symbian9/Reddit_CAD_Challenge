## Challenge A (Beginner)

![FIGURE A](http://imgur.com/a/kqjrw)

Design a [Regular Octahedron](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularOctahedron.html) with an edge length of 10mm. Do so using no more than Two Sketches and Two 3D Features. Post a screenshot showing the model + Feature Tree. What is the volume of the resultant shape?

BONUS: Label the model as though it were an 8 Sided Dice (opposing faces should add up to 9)

*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. If you're one of them. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can.*

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA, or a 3D Print?*

## Challenge B (Moderate)

Design a [Pentagonal Trapezohedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_trapezohedron). Do so using no more than Three Sketches, and Three 3D Features. The size of the model doesn't matter, as long as you can get the basic shape correct within the target number of sketches and features. Post a screenshot showing the model + Feature Tree.

BONUS: Label the model as though it were a 10 Sided Dice.

*The moderate challenge is for those who don't want to bother with the beginner but think the advanced is a bit too... advanced*

## Challenge C (Advanced)

Design a [Regular Dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_dodecahedron) with an Edge Length of 10mm, using no more than Four Sketches and 6 3D Features. Design the model entirely within the Part modeling environment in your CAD Package of choice. Post a screenshot showing the model + Feature Tree. What is the volume of the resultant shape?

BONUS: Label the model as though it were a 12 Sided Dice (opposing faces should add up to 13).

*Prove your worth with this challenge! Make a production drawing, render it in outer space, break the internet while uploading it. In other words: impress us.*
