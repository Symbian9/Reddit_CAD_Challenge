*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. If you're one of them. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can.*

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA?*

## Challenge B (Moderate)

*3-way trammel - Yes! One of these! Make up your own dimensions as you go.*

*The moderate challenge is for those who don't want to bother with the beginner but think the advanced is a bit too... advanced*

## Challenge C (Advanced)

Note: there is a real possibility that some dimensions are missing.
