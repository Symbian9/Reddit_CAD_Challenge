*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. If you're one of them. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can.* **LOOK OUT, FREEDOM UNIT**

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA?*

## Challenge B (Moderate)

*The moderate challenge is for those who don't want to bother with the beginner but think the advanced is a bit too... advanced*
