*The beginner challenge is meant for people with less than 6 months of experience. Reproduce this drawing as best as you can, if you're one of them.*

*If you are more experienced why not make a nice render as well? Maybe a FEA?*

**This week the challenge is to figure out all the dimensions yourself. Good Luck**

*Prove your worth with this challenge! Make a production drawing, render it in outer space, break the internet while uploading it. In other words: impress us.*
